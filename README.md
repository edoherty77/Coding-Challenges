# Coding-Challenges

In the codingTests.js file, there are about 40 coding challenges.
Each problem/solution has been commented out to avoid function name redundancy.

You can run the codingTests.html file in your browser, where the 'const output' will be console logged. 
Lines 1836 and 1837 in the js file will run whichever function you're working on. Just be sure to match the names of the functions at like 1836

All problems have been taken from either Codility.com, Hackerrank.com, Udemy courses I've taken, or GeneralAssembly class.
All solutions are completed. See if you can come up with your own, refactor mine, or code a more efficient solution.

Have fun!
